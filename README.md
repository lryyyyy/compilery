/**
 * Today we're going to write a compiler together. But not just any compiler... A
 * super duper teeny tiny compiler! A compiler that is so small that if you
 * remove all the comments this file would only be ~200 lines of actual code.
 *
 * We're going to compile some lisp-like function calls into some C-like
 * function calls.
 *
 * If you are not familiar with one or the other. I'll just give you a quick intro.
 *
 * If we had two functions `add` and `subtract` they would be written like this:
 *
 *                  LISP                      C
 *
 *   2 + 2          (add 2 2)                 add(2, 2)
 *   4 - 2          (subtract 4 2)            subtract(4, 2)
 *   2 + (4 - 2)    (add 2 (subtract 4 2))    add(2, subtract(4, 2))
 *
 * Easy peezy right?
 *
 * Well good, because this is exactly what we are going to compile. While this
 * is neither a complete LISP or C syntax, it will be enough of the syntax to
 * demonstrate many of the major pieces of a modern compiler.

/**
 * Most compilers break down into three primary stages: Parsing, Transformation,
 * and Code Generation
 *
 * 1. *Parsing* is taking raw code and turning it into a more abstract
 *    representation of the code.
 *
 * 2. *Transformation* takes this abstract representation and manipulates to do
 *    whatever the compiler wants it to.
 *
 * 3. *Code Generation* takes the transformed representation of the code and
 *    turns it into new code.
 */
```

```
/**
 * Parsing
 * -------
 *
 * Parsing typically gets broken down into two phases: Lexical Analysis and
 * Syntactic Analysis.
 *
 * 1. *Lexical Analysis* takes the raw code and splits it apart into these things
 *    called tokens by a thing called a tokenizer (or lexer).
 *
 *    Tokens are an array of tiny little objects that describe an isolated piece
 *    of the syntax. They could be numbers, labels, punctuation, operators,
 *    whatever.
 *
 * 2. *Syntactic Analysis* takes the tokens and reformats them into a
 *    representation that describes each part of the syntax and their relation
 *    to one another. This is known as an intermediate representation or
 *    Abstract Syntax Tree.
 *
 *    An Abstract Syntax Tree, or AST for short, is a deeply nested object that
 *    represents code in a way that is both easy to work with and tells us a lot
 *    of information.
 *
 * For the following syntax:
 *
 *   (add 2 (subtract 4 2))
 *
 * Tokens might look something like this:
 *
 *   [
 *     { type: 'paren',  value: '('        },
 *     { type: 'name',   value: 'add'      },
 *     { type: 'number', value: '2'        },
 *     { type: 'paren',  value: '('        },
 *     { type: 'name',   value: 'subtract' },
 *     { type: 'number', value: '4'        },
 *     { type: 'number', value: '2'        },
 *     { type: 'paren',  value: ')'        },
 *     { type: 'paren',  value: ')'        },
 *   ]
 *
 * And an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) might look like this:
 *
 *   {
 *     type: 'Program',
 *     body: [{
 *       type: 'CallExpression',
 *       name: 'add',
 *       params: [{
 *         type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *         value: '2',
 *       }, {
 *         type: 'CallExpression',
 *         name: 'subtract',
 *         params: [{
 *           type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *           value: '4',
 *         }, {
 *           type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *           value: '2',
 *         }]
 *       }]
 *     }]
 *   }
 */
```

```
/**
 * Transformation
 * --------------
 *
 * The next type of stage for a compiler is transformation. Again, this just
 * takes the AST from the last step and makes changes to it. It can manipulate
 * the AST in the same language or it can translate it into an entirely new
 * language.
 *
 * Let’s look at how we would transform an AST.
 *
 * You might notice that our AST has elements within it that look very similar.
 * There are these objects with a type property. Each of these are known as an
 * AST Node. These nodes have defined properties on them that describe one
 * isolated part of the tree.
 *
 * We can have a node for a "NumberLiteral":
 *
 *   {
 *     type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *     value: '2',
 *   }
 *
 * Or maybe a node for a "CallExpression":
 *
 *   {
 *     type: 'CallExpression',
 *     name: 'subtract',
 *     params: [...nested nodes go here...],
 *   }
 *
 * When transforming the AST we can manipulate nodes by
 * adding/removing/replacing properties, we can add new nodes, remove nodes, or
 * we could leave the existing AST alone and create an entirely new one based
 * on it.
 *
 * Since we’re targeting a new language, we’re going to focus on creating an
 * entirely new AST that is specific to the target language.
 *
 * Traversal
 * ---------
 *
 * In order to navigate through all of these nodes, we need to be able to
 * traverse through them. This traversal process goes to each node in the AST
 * depth-first.
 *
 *   {
 *     type: 'Program',
 *     body: [{
 *       type: 'CallExpression',
 *       name: 'add',
 *       params: [{
 *         type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *         value: '2'
 *       }, {
 *         type: 'CallExpression',
 *         name: 'subtract',
 *         params: [{
 *           type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *           value: '4'
 *         }, {
 *           type: 'NumberLiteral',
 *           value: '2'
 *         }]
 *       }]
 *     }]
 *   }
 *
 * So for the above AST we would go:
 *
 *   1. Program - Starting at the top level of the AST
 *   2. CallExpression (add) - Moving to the first element of the Program's body
 *   3. NumberLiteral (2) - Moving to the first element of CallExpression's params
 *   4. CallExpression (subtract) - Moving to the second element of CallExpression's params
 *   5. NumberLiteral (4) - Moving to the first element of CallExpression's params
 *   6. NumberLiteral (2) - Moving to the second element of CallExpression's params
 *
 * If we were manipulating this AST directly, instead of creating a separate AST,
 * we would likely introduce all sorts of abstractions here. But just visiting
 * each node in the tree is enough for what we're trying to do.
 *
 * The reason I use the word "visiting" is because there is this pattern of how
 * to represent operations on elements of an object structure.
 *
 * Visitors
 * --------
 *
 * The basic idea here is that we are going to create a “visitor” object that
 * has methods that will accept different node types.
 *
 *   var visitor = {
 *     NumberLiteral() {},
 *     CallExpression() {},
 *   };
 *
 * When we traverse our AST, we will call the methods on this visitor whenever we
 * "enter" a node of a matching type.
 *
 * In order to make this useful we will also pass the node and a reference to
 * the parent node.
 *
 *   var visitor = {
 *     NumberLiteral(node, parent) {},
 *     CallExpression(node, parent) {},
 *   };
 *
 * However, there also exists the possibility of calling things on "exit". Imagine
 * our tree structure from before in list form:
 *
 *   - Program
 *     - CallExpression
 *       - NumberLiteral
 *       - CallExpression
 *         - NumberLiteral
 *         - NumberLiteral
 *
 * As we traverse down, we're going to reach branches with dead ends. As we
 * finish each branch of the tree we "exit" it. So going down the tree we
 * "enter" each node, and going back up we "exit".
 *
 *   -> Program (enter)
 *     -> CallExpression (enter)
 *       -> Number Literal (enter)
 *       <- Number Literal (exit)
 *       -> Call Expression (enter)
 *          -> Number Literal (enter)
 *          <- Number Literal (exit)
 *          -> Number Literal (enter)
 *          <- Number Literal (exit)
 *       <- CallExpression (exit)
 *     <- CallExpression (exit)
 *   <- Program (exit)
 *
 * In order to support that, the final form of our visitor will look like this:
 *
 *   var visitor = {
 *     NumberLiteral: {
 *       enter(node, parent) {},
 *       exit(node, parent) {},
 *     }
 *   };
 */
```

```
/**
 * Code Generation
 * ---------------
 *
 * The final phase of a compiler is code generation. Sometimes compilers will do
 * things that overlap with transformation, but for the most part code
 * generation just means take our AST and string-ify code back out.
 *
 * Code generators work several different ways, some compilers will reuse the
 * tokens from earlier, others will have created a separate representation of
 * the code so that they can print nodes linearly, but from what I can tell most
 * will use the same AST we just created, which is what we’re going to focus on.
 *
 * Effectively our code generator will know how to “print” all of the different
 * node types of the AST, and it will recursively call itself to print nested
 * nodes until everything is printed into one long string of code.

/**
 * And that's it! That's all the different pieces of a compiler.
 *
 * Now that isn’t to say every compiler looks exactly like I described here.
 * Compilers serve many different purposes, and they might need more steps than
 * I have detailed.
 *
 * But now you should have a general high-level idea of what most compilers look
 * like.
 *
 * Now that I’ve explained all of this, you’re all good to go write your own
 * compilers right?
 *
 * Just kidding, that's what I'm here to help with :P
 *
 * So let's begin...
